- 🔭 I’m currently studing the fullstack web develpment at [Kadea Academy](https://cd.linkedin.com/company/kadeaacademy) where we were [incubated by Silikin Village](https://cd.linkedin.com/company/silikin-village) and sponsored by [Enabel DRC](https://fr.linkedin.com/company/enabel).
- 🌱 I’m passionate about [serverless in AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) and [Tensor](https://www.tensorflow.org).
- 📝 I’m aiming to post **one video per week** starting from January 2023.
- 🏆 I'm striving to increase my [GitHub stats rating](#🏆-my-stats) by contributing to [open source](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source).
